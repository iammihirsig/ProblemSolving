## About

Hey! I'm **Mihir Raj Singh** â€” this repo is my daily companion on the journey to mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.

Each day, I:
- ðŸ“˜ Log concepts I've studied
- ðŸ§  Record questions I've solved
- âœ… Track status (Brute Force, Optimal, etc.)

This journal isnâ€™t just for code â€” it's a reflection of my daily DSA grind ðŸ’ª.
